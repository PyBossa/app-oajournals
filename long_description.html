        Jevin West has kindly made available the list of 985 journals and their publishers that he uses in his excellent OA plot <a href="http://www.eigenfactor.org/openaccess/index.php">here</a>.

        </p>
        <p>
        And we would like to build on this data to assess the licence used by each one of those 985 journals to publish their articles.
        </p>
        <p>
        We have started the task on a collaborative PyBossa app, where all you have to do is to Google the journal name, and select from a set of options the license for the Journal and who owns the Copyright.
        </p>
        <p>
        All data filled-in on the datasheet will be public domain data for anyone to <a href="http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/">use/copy/remix CC0</a>
